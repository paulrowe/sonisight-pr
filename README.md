SoniSight is an diagnostic web app that analyzes breast ultrasound images to identify normal vs. suspicious masses.  
It uses AI to highlight regions of interest and explain why a mass might appear abnormal.

This project was built for the Congressional App Challenge and inspired by my motherâ€™s experience with uncertain biopsy results.

How It Works
1. Upload an ultrasound image or choose from built-in sample images.
2. The backend (FastAPI + OpenCV) extracts image features like:
   - Shape, margins, and texture
   - Contrast and circularity
3. Gemini AI analyzes those descriptors and outputs:
   - Probabilities for normal** vs suspicious
   - A short, human-readable rationale
4. A visual overlay highlights the detected region of interest.
